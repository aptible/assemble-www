          HIPAA defines requirements for companies that create, receive, maintain,
          or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI, or PHI).

        %p
          The HIPAA Security Rule states that companies must implement “reasonable
          and appropriate safeguards” over PHI, but identifying and implementing
          exactly what those requirements can be challenging.

        %p
          Aptible Enclave implements a large number of the safeguards
          required by the HIPAA Security Rule, helping you to achieve HIPAA compliance. By deploying your apps and
          databases on Enclave, you can go to market faster and with greater
          confidence.

            For
            HIPAA hosting, we’ll sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
            together. Signing a BAA with us is a legal requirement required for
            hosting PHI on Enclave.

        Physical Safeguards
      %h3.subtitle.subtitle--with-hr
        HIPAA mandates Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310) such as a Facility Security Plan, Access Control, Maintenance Records, and Contingency Operations. These requirements
        protect the systems hosting PHI from natural and environmental
        hazards or unauthorized intrusion.
      %p
        %strong Enclave
        is built on AWS, so applications deployed on Enclave inherit many Physical Safeguards from AWS's own physical security measures. Enclave also ensures that database backups are distributed across multiple regions, meeting Contingency Operations requirements and ensuring your data won't be lost in the event of a disaster compromising any individual data center.

        Administrative Safeguards
      %h3.subtitle.subtitle--with-hr
        HIPAA Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308) proscribe the implementation of a comprehensive security management program. Among other things, HIPAA requires the preparation of contingency and incident response plans, train your workforce, and periodically assess your performance.
      %p
        %strong Enclave
        makes it easier to manage this security
        program by implementing many of HIPAA's requirements, thus minimizing the scope of your security management
        program.

        Beyond HIPAA: Vendor Assessments
      %h3.subtitle.light-blue-gray
        Meeting HIPAA requirements is only the baseline of what you must comply with when deploying applications processing PHI.
      %h3.subtitle.light-blue-gray
        Potential partners and customers such as hospitals and
        insurance networks will often impose much more stringent and specific
        requirements upon you as part of their vendor assessments. Enclave offers security controls that help you go above and beyond HIPAA requirements.
