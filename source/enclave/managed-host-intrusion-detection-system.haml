          %p.subtitle.light-blue-gray
            Your cloud infrastructure is protected at the host level with both
            intrusion detection monitoring and incident response. The Aptible
            Security Team investigates, responds to, and resolves any security
            incidents that are discovered via the HIDS.

      %h3.subtitle
        Your host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an important tool to
        manage your stack’s security.

        %p
          Your infrastructure generates a constant stream of events relevant to the
          security of your data.  Aptible Enclave® HIDS is installed on each host that
          runs your containers by default and will detect potential intrusions and other
          anomalous activities.
        %p
          The Aptible Security Team monitors and investigates each event to determine
          the legitimacy of all activity. Crucially, the Aptible Security Team
          immediately responds to and resolves any issues that are discovered through
          investigation of anomalous activity and will notify you of any remediation
          steps taken.
        %p
          You can optionally subscribe to the Enclave HIDS Compliance Report to provide
          your customers and auditors evidence that you are using HIDS to monitor,
          analyze, and remediate security events.
