You can easily scale your app, both horizontally and vertically. In the
[Aptible Dashboard](https://dashboard.aptible.com), navigate to your app.

Your app's [services][about-services] are each listed, along with the service's
current container count and RAM footprint per container.

To scale horizontally, adjust the "Containers" slider. To scale vertically,
adjust the "Memory" slider. When you are ready, select "Scale." The Aptible
platform will scale your app service to your new specifications. You can use
the same process to scale your app down.
