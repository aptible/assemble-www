Aptible provides free managed HTTPS for both internal and external endpoints.
Managed HTTPS Endpoints offer the following benefits:

  * Automated certificate provisioning
  * Automated certificate renewals
  * Monitoring to detect problems with renewals and alert you

**Requirements:**

  * A custom domain name

**Setting up a Managed HTTPS Endpoint is a 3-step process:**

  1. Add an Endpoint to your app, and choose Managed HTTPS as the endpoint type. You will need to provide the domain name you intend to use with your app (e.g. health-on-rails.example.com). Aptible will use that name to provision a certificate via Let's Encrypt.

  2. When you create the endpoint, Aptible will provide you with an endpoint address. Use your DNS provider to create a CNAME from your domain (\_acme-check.health-on-rails.example.com) to this endpoint address (something like \_acme-check.alb-production-1337.aptible.in).

  3. Back in the Aptible Dashboard, confirm that you created the CNAME. Aptible will automatically provision your certificate, and youâ€™re in business!

Note that this DNS challenge method works for Internal and External Endpoits with IP Filtering!
